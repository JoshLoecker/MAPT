### Profiling Statistics
This is a set of statistics that have been generated by running the command `/usr/bin/time -v [snakemake commands]`  
The purpose of these statistics are to attempt to determine two primary items:
1. RAM usage
2. Wall time


This is a very ugly script, and is absolutely not ready for real world use. I included it here in case it is wanted or needed for future development.
As of now, it will only work if folders are located within the current directory. The script looks for folders that contain the keywords `silva`, `zymo_modified`, and `zymo` (in that order).


**<ins>Known bugs</ins>**
- If the folder requirements are not met, the script will not work
- If the input files have not been run with `/usr/bin/time -v [command]`, the script will probably appear to have worked, but no errors will be shown
- It probably isn't documented thoroughly enough
